# Command_Line_TODO

This folder contains code for implementing a command-line (CLI) program that
lets the user's manage their todos.

- We can add tasks directly from Command Line to our TODO List
- We can mark them as Completed when needed.
- We can delete the task as per requirement.
- We can also keep track of statistics of out TODO List.

This was written by me as a part of `CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship` Test.
